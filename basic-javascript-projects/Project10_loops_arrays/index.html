        In terms of speed and performance, the defer attribute in a <script> tag in the document <head> element is a better choice over the async attribute because it ensures that there is no delay in the parsing of the HTML document. The defer attribute is also a better choice over the <script> tag at the end of the <body> element because it ensures the script is loaded and ready to be executed by that time.-->
