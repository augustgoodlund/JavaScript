<h3>Pizza Menu</h3>
This project uses HTML and CSS to build and style a pizza restaurant menu. It has an online ordering functionality that takes the input user choices and calculates a price based on the order.
<h3>TicTacToe Game</h3>
A game of Tic-Tac-Toe where the user plays the computer. The user inputs their choice, and then the computer chooses a square. The program plays a sound effect when a piece is placed, or in the event of a win or tie game. 
<h3>Calculator</h3>
A basic 4-function web calculator that can be used to add, subtract, multiply, or divide.
